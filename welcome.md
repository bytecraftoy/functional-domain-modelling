# Functional Domain Modelling

Welcome to Functional Domain Modelling hands-on session.

We will do simple exercise(s) on Domain Driven Design
using Functional Programming principles.

You should have your favourite programming environment ready.
Familiarity with statically typed language such as Kotlin, TypeScript, Scala and F#
might help to follow examples.
No prior knowledge about Domain Driven Design or Functional Programming is required,
but understanding very basics of both helps a lot.

Please, take a look at material beforehand if you have time:

We are practicing techniques described by Scott Wlaschin in his book
[Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/).
